# FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY

These modules are for **demonstration purposes only**. They have not been hardened and **should not be deployed in Production environments**, or any environment with actual data. They are included to showcase system capbilites, serve as the basis for customized modules.

The web servers deployed by these modules may have Basic Authentication, Use pre-signed URLs, Self-Signed Certificates for HTTPS, or provide only HTTP endpoints. It should be possible to integrate these with Authentication Providers (e.g. Amazon Cognito) and deploy valid Certificates.
